# Linux-Bash-Commands
Some Linux commands created by me and a bash script

The problem I tried to resolve with my bash script

Bash script to take an argument initially and then to prompt for input until a control value is entered. The input is a string of characters and the script should count the digits (0-9) and alphabetic characters (a-z A-Z) entered. Any other values should be counted as non-alphanumeric characters. Once the control value has been entered the script should exit and print out the number of digits, letters and other characters entered
